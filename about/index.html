            <p>We are a group of young dreamers, currently 19 years old on average, who are just dissatisfied with what we can do with existing social networks. “Ephemeral”, “anonymous”, or “location-based” apps are simply not designed for us to share <span class="italic">meaningful</span> moments with our <span class="italic">close</span> friends. Trying to solve this problem, we are now the first to implement the concept of “Flip Social”, where your stories are told by your friends. </p>
            <p>We care because we are building a product for so many people just like ourselves. We care because we are elevated to see friends become closer and happier. We care so much that we dropped out of UChicago, Berkeley, and UCSD to build SketchMe, a place where friends share fun and warm moments of each other. </p>
            <p>If you share our care and vision, we’d love to have you <a href="/join" class="emphasize">join us</a>. We have just closed a million-dollar seed round in order to build the future of social with the best people in the world. </p>
